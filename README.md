## Dataset
There is a provided dataset in the repository. This is a dataset which contains dummy housing prices for Oslo. The pricings are solely based upon square meters, which in reality alone would not provide enough context to determine housing prices. Note that the data has been generated randomly and does not reflect actual prices.
